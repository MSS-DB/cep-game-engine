## Description

[Nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) framework TypeScript starter repository.

Game Engine is a system that allows creation of campaigns/events such as Fortune Rain to allow the consumers to
* Create, send, or receive challenge(s) on a game/event that they have created to each other.
* Collect different types of rewards after the completing the challenges.
* Process of the transactions based on the transactions coming from other systems.


### Modules/Services
Located at [apps](apps) directory, the services are defined as the following:

* [campaign-setup](apps%2Fcampaign-setup): Setup new campaign for the upcoming game events.
* [cep-game-engine](apps%2Fcep-game-engine) (main): Main application.
* [game-engine](apps%2Fgame-engine): Process games created by the users. Store game results information.
* [reward-redemption](apps%2Freward-redemption): Claim the rewards from the game.
* [task](apps%2Ftask): A task is considered as a game event happened in the system.
* [transaction-log](apps%2Ftransaction-log): Producing rewards from the transactions based on the game rules defined.


### Ports:
Ports of each microservice is different to launch the microservices in the terminal without conflicts.
* campaign-setup: 3001
* cep-game-engine (main): 3000
* game-engine: 3002
* reward-redemption: 3003
* task: 3004
* transaction-log: 3005

# Note(s):
* **Monorepo** design. So all modules are created within the project itself.
* Every module is build as **microservice**. So that the app can be individually deployed and scaled during production.
* Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) are created in a library module in order to
* Using the following:
  * Typescript
  * Prettier: To format code, imports of the project.
  * Jest: For unit testing.

# Development

## Project Setup

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Compile and run the project

```bash
# development
$ npm run start

# watch mode
$ npm run start:dev

# production mode
$ npm run start:prod
```

## Module Creation
To create new microservices in the project, execute the following:

```bash
nest generate app MODULE_NAME
```

For example:
```bash
nest generate app game-engine
```

This creates a directory that defines a controller, service, routes and tests that are configured automatically.

### Start the Module Individually
```bash
nest start MODULE_NAME
```

For example:
```bash
nest start game-engine
```

## Library Creation
To create reusable components that can be share across modules (for example Authentication), execute the following:

```bash
nest generate library MODULE_NAME
```

For example,
```bash
nest generate library auth
```

## Testing

Ensure the test cases are executed within the given framework and approved libraries successfully without causing issues in software delivery.

Execute the following:
```bash
# unit tests
$ npm run test

# e2e tests
$ npm run test:e2e

# test coverage
$ npm run test:cov
```
